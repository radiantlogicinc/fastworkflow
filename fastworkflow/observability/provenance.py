"""What produced this run: engine, workflow, and model identity.

The fastWorkflow-origin half of the evaluation provenance contract in
architecture §6.3. An evaluation harness embeds this in its own
`EvaluationProvenance` alongside the axes it owns — corpus, task contracts,
evaluators, tenant/principal/dataset/timeslot fingerprints, and backend
attestations. Those are deliberately absent here: fastWorkflow cannot attest to
them, and a provenance writer that invents a value from local configuration is
the failure §6.3 spends a paragraph forbidding.

The point of the module is that these values are *hard to get right one at a
time*, and a harness assembling them ad hoc gets them wrong in ways nothing
detects. Four traps, each measured on this codebase rather than imagined:

**The installed version is stale.** `importlib.metadata.version("fastworkflow")`
answers 2.30.1 while `pyproject.toml` says 3.2.0, because an editable install's
`dist-info` is written once and never tracks a version bump. Neither number is
"the" version, so both are recorded and their disagreement is itself evidence.

**A dirty tree makes the revision a lie.** A git revision identifies the code
only if nothing is modified on top of it. Dirtiness is therefore recorded beside
it, and `None` means "could not tell" — never `False`.

**`None` from the artifact resolver does not mean untrained.** A workflow on the
pre-versioning layout has no `current.json` and resolves to `None` while being
fully trained; both bundled `hello_world` workflows are in exactly that state.
`legacy_layout` carries the difference, and without it the record reports a
trained workflow as untrained.

**A cache hit means no model was called.** DSPy's cache is process-global, so a
run with caching on is not evidence about the model that appears in
`model_identifiers`. The cache state is a peer of the model string here, not a
footnote.

Naming, because two things in this repo are called a fingerprint and only one of
them is identity: `workflow_source_hash` is the canonical content hash of §7.1 —
reproducible from bytes, independent of path and mtime.
`command_surface_fingerprint` is `compute_commands_source_fingerprint`, which
hashes absolute paths plus `(size, mtime_ns)`. That one is correct for
invalidating a cache and wrong for identifying a workflow; it is recorded
because §6.3 asks for it, under a name that says which one it is.

Leaf module (arch §22): standard library, Pydantic, and `runtime_manifest` only.
Values that live behind a non-leaf module — the trained-artifact id and layout
flag in `train.artifact_versioning`, the legacy fingerprint in
`command_directory`, DSPy's process-global cache state — are caller-supplied
arguments rather than something this module reaches for. That is about the
dependency graph, not about speed: importing anything under `fastworkflow.`
already executes the package root, so no arrangement of this module avoids that
cost. What it avoids is this module depending on the training stack and command
routing, which is what §22 is protecting.
