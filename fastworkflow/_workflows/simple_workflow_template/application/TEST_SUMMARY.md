## Test Coverage Overview

### Core Functionality Tested

#### ChildSchema Class
- ✓ Valid initialization with all parameter combinations
- ✓ Default value handling
- ✓ Validation of empty/invalid workitem types
- ✓ Validation of negative cardinality values
- ✓ Validation of min > max cardinality
- ✓ Serialization to dictionary (`to_dict()`)
- ✓ Deserialization from dictionary (`from_dict()`)

#### WorkflowSchema Class
- ✓ Minimal initialization
- ✓ Initialization with workflow types
- ✓ Initialization with child schemas
- ✓ Validation of schema consistency
- ✓ Auto-addition of missing workflow types
- ✓ WorkItem creation with schema enforcement
- ✓ JSON file serialization/deserialization
- ✓ Error handling for invalid configurations

#### WorkItem Class - Basic Functionality
- ✓ Minimal initialization (uses class name as default type)
- ✓ Initialization with custom workitem type
- ✓ Parent-child relationships
- ✓ Data dictionary operations (`__getitem__`, `__setitem__`, `clear_data_dict`)
- ✓ Property getters and setters (`is_complete`, `workitem_type`, `parent`)
- ✓ Validation of workitem types (no spaces allowed)

#### Child Management
- ✓ Adding children without schema constraints
- ✓ Adding children with schema validation
- ✓ Removing children with constraint checking
- ✓ Child indexing and position tracking
- ✓ Type-filtered child access
- ✓ Child counting (total and by type)
- ✓ Removing all children with constraint validation
- ✓ Automatic creation of minimum required children

#### Schema Enforcement
- ✓ Min/max cardinality enforcement
- ✓ Allowed child type validation
- ✓ Error handling for constraint violations
- ✓ Complex multi-type child schemas
- ✓ Nested schema inheritance

#### Path Operations
- ✓ Absolute path generation (`get_absolute_path()`)
- ✓ Relative path navigation (`_get_child_workitem()`)
- ✓ Absolute path navigation (`get_workitem()`)
- ✓ Path parsing with type and index notation
- ✓ Error handling for invalid paths
- ✓ Deep nesting support (tested to 10 levels)

#### Navigation
- ✓ Next workitem traversal (`get_next_workitem()`)
- ✓ Type-filtered navigation
- ✓ Tree climbing for sibling navigation
- ✓ Handling of end-of-tree conditions

#### Serialization
- ✓ WorkItem to dictionary conversion (`_to_dict()`)
- ✓ WorkItem from dictionary creation (`_from_dict()`)
- ✓ Data preservation across serialization

### Advanced Scenarios Tested

#### Performance & Scale
- ✓ **100 children** - Tests performance with large child collections
- ✓ **10-level deep nesting** - Tests deep hierarchical structures
- ✓ **Complex schemas** - Multi-type, multi-constraint schemas
- ✓ **Concurrent modifications** - Position updates during child removal

#### Edge Cases
- ✓ Empty paths and invalid path formats
- ✓ Out-of-range child indices
- ✓ Non-existent child types
- ✓ Schema with max_cardinality = 0 (no children allowed)
- ✓ Multiple child types on same parent
- ✓ Position updates after child removal

#### Error Conditions
- ✓ All ValueError conditions properly raised
- ✓ All IndexError conditions properly handled
- ✓ All KeyError conditions properly raised
- ✓ Constraint violation detection and reporting
