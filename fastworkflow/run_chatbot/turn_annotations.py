#     between the turn record's `execution_records` refs and the trace's
#     `fw.command.execute` spans (and the span-less inner hops those spans
#     file under `child_calls`);
# (b) the turn's decision signals -- the least confident intent resolution's
#     top-k margin, whether the user was asked, and the worst consequence
#     class any dispatch was assessed at -- and the low-confidence filter
#     they feed;
# (c) an experiment's provenance, flattened from the evidence-run records,
#     the experiment row and the attempts' runtime snapshots, plus the
#     field-by-field difference between two experiments' provenance;
# (d) cost roll-ups from the `cost` attribute on `fw.llm.call`.
#
# Every one of them says "not recorded" for an absence rather than inventing
# a value: a missing margin is no chip and not a low-confidence turn, and a
# missing cost is never a zero.
