"""One input -- the model's context window -- and every byte budget derived from it.

Before this module the framework carried seven independent byte
knobs (``FW_TRAJECTORY_MAX_BYTES``, ``FW_ANSWER_REHYDRATION_MAX_BYTES``,
``FW_RESULT_PAGE_MAX_BYTES``, ``FW_SEARCH_ANSWER_MAX_BYTES``,
``FW_OFFLOAD_HOT_MAX_BYTES``, ``FW_RESULT_HANDLE_HOT_MAX_BYTES``,
``FW_OFFLOAD_MIN_SAVING_BYTES``), each with a constant of its own. The two
result-handle budgets are gone with the result-handle package; the history is
kept because it is what the fractions below were derived against. Every one of
them answers the same question -- how much of the model's context window may
this thing occupy -- so every one of them is now a fixed FRACTION of ONE input
and none of them has to be set to move a workflow to a bigger or smaller model.

The input, in this order:

1. ``FW_MODEL_CONTEXT_TOKENS``, when the deployment states it outright.
2. the main agent model's own metadata -- ``litellm.get_model_info(model)``
   ``max_input_tokens`` for the model named by ``LLM_AGENT`` -- so a workflow
   that changes models changes its budgets by changing its model.
3. the documented fallback, ``REFERENCE_WINDOW_TOKENS`` (131,072), which is the
   window the current values were calibrated against.

The conversion from tokens to bytes happens exactly once, here:
``BYTES_PER_TOKEN = 4``. It is a presentation constant, not a tokenizer: these
budgets bound UTF-8 bytes of prompt text and 4 bytes/token is the ratio the
measured runs sat at. Nothing else in the framework converts tokens to bytes.

Calibration. The fractions are pinned so that the reference window -- 131,072
tokens, which is what ``litellm`` reports as ``max_input_tokens`` for
``cerebras/gpt-oss-120b`` -- reproduces the previously hand-set values EXACTLY:
28,000 packed-trajectory target, 250,000 rehydration bytes, 3,072 bytes for a
result page and for a search answer, 262,144 bytes for each hot cache and 1,024
bytes of minimum offload saving. ``tests/test_context_budget.py`` asserts that
identity, so a change to a fraction that would move one of those values fails
the suite.

Overrides. Each budget keeps its ``FW_*_MAX_BYTES`` name as a TUNING override,
for the case where one budget has to move without moving the others. They are
not the interface: a deployment sets the window (or lets the model's metadata
set it) and leaves them alone. An override below the budget's floor is refused
with a warning and the derived value stands, exactly as the individual knobs
behaved before. The search-observation bound (``SEARCH_OBSERVATION``) is the
one derived budget with a ceiling; its override
``FW_SEARCH_OBSERVATION_MAX_BYTES`` goes through the same parsing and floor,
and may exceed that ceiling.

What is NOT here. The per-attribute cap on values written to the observability
STORE does not belong to this family: it bounds a database row, not a model
prompt. It is a constant (``fastworkflow.tracing.MAX_ATTR_BYTES``).
