"""Per-emitter span attribute contracts (bead fix-ajv.8, arch §12.0 delta 5).

`tracing.SPAN_CONTRACT_VERSION` can say that something in the taxonomy moved
between two runs. It cannot say what. `tracing.SPAN_CONTRACTS` declares a version
and an attribute-key set per emitter so a reader who notices the aggregate moved
can find the emitter, and so a stored span describes its own contract without a
lookup table.

Declared numbers are worth nothing unless something forces them to track the
code, so most of this file is one AST pass and the checks it feeds:

**Coverage.** Every span name any emitter opens must have a contract. Discovered
by scanning the whole package for `start_span` and for `tracing.Span(name=...)`
reconstructions, so a new emitter anywhere fails here rather than being noticed
later by a reader with a gap in their data.

**Attribute agreement.** The declared key set must equal the keys the emitters
actually write. Discovery follows the keys into the bags they are written to:
`nlu_trace` and `diagnostics` are filled statements (and, for `diagnostics`,
modules) away from the emission site, `**tracing.capture_attributes(...)` is a
shared projection, and a scan that looked only at the dict literal beside
`attributes=` would see about half of the real contract and quietly bless the
rest. Adding a key therefore forces an edit to the declaration, which puts the
version under the cursor — the closest a static check gets to "you cannot add a
key without deciding about the version", and strictly better than the
hand-maintained list it replaces, which had no way to notice a bag.

**Producer agreement.** `fw.agent.tool_call` is opened from THREE sites. One
version for that name is a lie unless the three write the same keys, so the rule
is enforced rather than asserted in a comment: every function that *opens* a span
of a given name must write the same set. Functions that RECONSTRUCT a span (the
`Span(...)` rebuilds that close `fw.turn` and `fw.ask_user` across a suspension)
are exempt, because they are a later phase of one span rather than an alternative
producer of it — their keys join the union without having to match the open.

Both scans have a self-test against a known-bad sample: a structural check nobody
has watched reject anything is decoration
(`test_no_capture_control_flow.py::test_the_scan_would_actually_catch_a_read`).

The integration half runs the real todo_list_workflow through the real
WorkflowExecutionContext into a real SQLite sink, because the static half proves
what the source says and not what a span ends up carrying.
